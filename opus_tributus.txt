Introduction and Disclaimer:
The United States of America (U.S.A.) federal individual tax system is main concern of the following thoughts. 
The pieces are simplified because they do not consider the complex interactions due to or direct consequences of many other economic phenomena and policies. 
These policies include and are not limited to the U.S.A government's fiscal policy, the U.S.A. corporate tax system, and the U.S.A. Federal Reserve Systems' actions.
These parties are not considered and thus the individual tax system is treated in relative isolation. 
This isolation simplifies the analysis and increases clarity.
Thus the ideas proposed are nascent ideas and thoughts and should not be considered policy recommendations or endorsements. 
Before those policy recommendations and direction can be sent, the inherent consequences must be more carefully analyzed and argued.
The below thoughts and opinions are the author's alone and do not reflect the views of any corporation or entity associated with whom they are associated.
